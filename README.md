# Sidra Mehak â€“ Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. It includes all the major sections to introduce myself as a cybersecurity student, my skills, education, projects, experience, and contact information.

## Features

- Responsive layout for both desktop and mobile
- Tailwind CSS utility-first design
- Sections: Home, About, Skills, Education, Certifications, Experience, Projects, Contact
- Clean interface without scroll issues
- Interactive animations on hover
- Real-world projects linked with GitHub

## My Experience

This was my first complete website. I learned how small details in spacing, padding, and responsiveness can affect the entire user experience. Tailwind CSS helped me understand how styling works with utility classes, and it made development faster once I got the hang of it. The mobile view gave me some trouble, but fixing it taught me how to debug layout issues properly. This project helped me see the connection between design and development.

## Screenshots

Final UI screenshots for desktop and mobile views are included in the folders.
